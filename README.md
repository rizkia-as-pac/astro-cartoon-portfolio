Personal website and blog of **Rizkia Adhy Syahputra**.

This site serves as a simple portfolio and a personal writing space. It’s a place where I share projects, notes, thoughts, and anything I feel like writing—technical or otherwise.

## About

I’m Rizkia Adhy Syahputra, a Full-Stack Developer who enjoys building and maintaining web applications. I work across backend and frontend, focusing on clear logic, structured code, and reliable systems.

I enjoy learning how systems work end to end, improving designs gradually, and keeping things maintainable rather than overcomplicated.
