This section covers various hobby and personal projects I’ve worked on since 2021. These projects are usually built during free time and are driven by curiosity rather than specific requirements or deadlines.

## Overview

The work here ranges from small experimental applications to simple tools and scripts. Some projects focus on exploring new ideas, while others aim to solve small problems encountered in daily development work.

## Focus Areas

A significant part of these projects involves optimizing my working environment, especially around Linux and Neovim. This includes configuration tweaks, automation scripts, and lightweight tools to improve workflow efficiency and reduce friction during development.

## Notes

These projects are not always polished or production-ready, but they play an important role in continuous learning and personal growth. Many ideas from these experiments later influence how I approach larger and more structured projects.
