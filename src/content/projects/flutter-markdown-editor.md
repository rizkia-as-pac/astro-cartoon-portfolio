This project is a Flutter-based note application developed as an exploration project at **Universitas Teknologi Yogyakarta**. It focuses on building a clean and modular frontend architecture using Flutter and Riverpod, while also serving as a sandbox for integrating external services.

## Overview

The application provides a simple note and markdown editing workflow. Beyond the editor itself, the project is used to explore how a Flutter application can handle additional concerns such as user state, feature boundaries, and payment-related flows in a controlled environment.

**The main emphasis is on code structure and maintainability rather than feature completeness.**

## Payment Integration Experiment

One of the key experiments in this project is integrating a payment gateway into a Flutter application. This includes exploring payment initiation from the client side, handling payment states, and understanding how payment-related logic fits into the overall application structure.

The payment integration is experimental and intended for learning purposes, not for production use.

## Current State

The project was developed between November 2024 and January 2025 and remains an experimental codebase. It continues to be used as a reference for frontend architecture patterns and payment integration experiments.

## Notes

This project is intentionally kept simple in scope, allowing focused experimentation on frontend structure and third-party service integration without adding unnecessary complexity.
